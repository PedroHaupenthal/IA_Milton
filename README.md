# BV and Wine Analytics with AI
This repository contains two simple example projects of applying a **Convolutional Neural Network** (CNN) using only **C/C++** and given mass of data for training. 

### BV Analytics
Determines the moment of purchase / sale of an asset given a certain degree of risk, given training performed in a dataset.

### Wine Analytics
Determines the quality of the wine given certain factors such as volatile and citrus acidity, sugar, density, pH, alcohol level etc. These characteristics are considered for two types of wine, the first being white wine and the second red.
